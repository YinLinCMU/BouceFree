# BouceFree

**PM Report (Yichen Liu and Yin Lin)**

The whole report is in a dialog format in which developer (Yin Lin) and PM (Yichen Liu) are involved.

### Week 0

PM: Add barrier to game so player will notice that if they touch the barrier, they will game over.
 
Developer: Not finished, can't find a good-looking barrier on all websites provided by instructors so feature abandoned.
 
**Plan change approved**

### Week 1
 
PM: Since we won't use barrier to indicate the death of user, we can change to another way

Developer: Instead of creating barriers, loop the movement of character from top to bottom when it is out of bound.
 
**Successfully implemented**

### Week 2

PM: It would be better to let players know their score to promote themselves to achieve higher score. This could heavily affect player's time spending on the game.

Developer: Now the user can see the score of their progress.

**Successfully implemented**

### Week 3

PM: Sound effects would polish the game and make it more fun to play. For example, if we have different musics when playing in different levels. It would generate a sense of satisfaction for player to keep gaming.
 
Developer: Add cute background music and sound effect when game over or collect a coin.
 
**Successfully implemented**

### Week 4

PM: Visual effects are also very imprtant when polishing a game.
