## PM Report by Yichen Liu

### Week0: Add barriers to the game
 
 + Not finished, developer can't find a good barrier so plan changed.

### Week1: Add looping bounce

 + Instead of creating barriers, loop the movement of character from top to bottom when it is out of bound. You finished it successfully and this feature improves the game experience as well.

### Week2: Add Scores

 + Now the user can see the score of their progress.  This feature is important because user will always want to know the current status of their game progress.

### Week3: Add basic sound effects
 
 + Only bakcground music and screen-touch toggle sound is enabled. You might need to add some sound effects for success and failure.

### week4: Add advanced sound effects and visual effects
 
 + Add some visual effects when the user reaches a new high score and when the user touches objects including coins and ghosts.
